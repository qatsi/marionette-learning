{"name":"Marionette-learning","tagline":"My Marionette way","body":"# Marionette + Foundation example\r\n\r\nHeck! The easiest way to understand `Marionette` + `Foundation`.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* Passion\r\n* Brain (at least one hemisphere)\r\n* Hands\r\n* Milk\r\n\r\n## Quickstart\r\nThis is very hard to determine entry point. The mixture is the following:\r\n\r\n* [Marionette.js](http://marionettejs.com/) with dependencies\r\n* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) with its dependencies too\r\n* [Bower](http://bower.io/) as Web-packages manager\r\n* To be continuedâ€¦\r\n\r\nPlease consider the following places to understand what is under the hood:\r\n\r\n  * This README.md\r\n  * `bower.json` it describes packages used in project\r\n  * `.bowerrc` **bower** web packages manager config. This is folder where bower packages installed to. These are shared JavaScript libraries so they are ignored by git.\r\n  * `config.rb` [compass](http://compass-style.org/) configuration files. Some paths and setting are covered here. Feel free to change something and watch how `compass watch` will become nuts.\r\n  * `index.html` sorry, right now it's static. No comments here :-(\r\n  * `.gitignore` watch out stuff described here tends to be be overwritten!\r\n\r\n## Workflow \r\nThen when you're working on your stylesheet i.e. hacking Foundation styles, just run the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncompass watch\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlay with `./assets/scss/_settings.scss` and watch the magic.\r\nStatement above will recreate `css` stylesheet from your `scss` templates on the fly.\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to upgrade to a newer version of Foundation or Marionette or etc. down the road just run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbower update\r\n```\r\n\r\n##TODO\r\n\r\nThat is the favorite part.\r\n\r\n* Follow the book i.e. finish yet another *TodoApp*\r\n* Add some Ruby backend (*Sinatra*?)\r\n  * To serve HAML templates\r\n  * To eliminate assert hell\r\n* Add some event driven Ruby backend\r\n  * Push server messages (*Goliath* + *WebSockets*?)\r\n  * To store something to *PostgreSQL*\r\n  * To store something to *Redis*\r\n* Add some event driven Node.js backend for somewhat\r\n* Add `Cucumber` tests with JavaScript testing\r\n* Add `Guardfile`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
